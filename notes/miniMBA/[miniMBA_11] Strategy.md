### Porter's 5 Forces

- Replaces the opportunities and threats portion of the SWOT analysis.
- Analyzes the industry (not your company)
- Predicts average industry profitability
- Useful to guide strategic decisions within your industry

Porter's 5 Forces are:

1. Threat of New Entrants
2. Bargaining Power of Buyers
3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
4. Rivalry among Existing Competitors
5. Threat of Substitute Products of Services



### Threat of New Entrants

##### Common Barriers to Entry

- - Capital Requirements - How much money does it cost for a business to enter the industry? The threat is higher when the capital barrier is lower (t-shirts vs. airline industry)
  - Economies of Scale - Are you producing enough product to bring down the cost of production? Without reaching a minimum efficient scale you will be at a disadvantage in the industry, making it a barrier to entry (automobile industry).
  - Network Effects - Are you trying to enter an industry where value is increased as more people use something (social networks, standard software)? Trying to break into an industry with a well-established network of use can be difficult.
  - Regulation - Stringent regulations on activities with an industry (pharmaceuticals, medical research) can be a barrier to entry.

### Bargaining Power of Buyers & Suppliers

Considered together since sometimes you are a buyer (from your suppliers) and sometimes you are a supplier (to your customers).

##### Elements of Bargaining Power

- - - **Switching Costs** - How much does it cost to change from purchasing from one person to purchasing through another (such as cell phones carriers)? A higher switching cost reduces a buyer's bargaining power.
    - **Numbers Game** - Are you the only source of your product? Is there one buyer and many suppliers? The balance between number of suppliers and the number of buyers shifts the bargaining power one way or the other.
    - **Threat of integration** - In a business-to-business context, the buyer could decide to become their own supplier (such as paper company buying own lumber yard).
    - **Differentiation of your product** - A unique product gives the supplier a higher bargaining power.



### Rivalry among Existing Competitors

Concerns firms who are already within the industry and how we can win customers from them.

##### Winning Customers

- - DO NOT compete on price - worst form of competition, everyone makes less profit. 
  - DO compete on differentiation
  - DO compete on brand or marketing
  - DO compete on location or distribution

### Threat of Substitute Products of Services

Concerns products or services that are outside of your industry such as other forms of transportation as a substitute for airline travel.

##### Questions to Ask about Substitutes

- - How close is the substitute?
  - How does the price of the substitute compare?

The tradeoffs for the answers to these questions determines the threat level. For example, walking is free but is not a close substitute for flying on an airplane if the destination is far away.

### Resources-Based View

How do you know if your resources help you beat competition?

A firm is a bundle of resources both tangible and intangible and can include physical locations, website, chairs, computers, insurance, brand, culture, intellectual property, accumulated experience, relationships, etc.

##### VRIO Framework

A VRIO Analysis can help determine whether the resources will lead to a sustainable competitive advantage over your competitors.

**V**aluable if it helps exploit an opportunity or offset a threat.

**R**are if only one or a few firms possess it.

**I**mitation is costly if competitors canâ€™t develop the resource for a reasonable price.

**O**rganized around if the firm can capture value through effective organizational structure and coordinating systems.

If a resource, capability or competency is:

- - Not Valuable - you will be at a competitive disadvantage
  - Valuable but ***not*** rare - you will have competitive parity
  - Valuable and rare but ***not*** costly to imitate - you will have a temporary competitive advantage
  - Valuable, rare, costly to imitate but ***not*** organized around - you will have a temporary competitive advantage
  - Valuable, rare, costly to imitate and organized around - you will have a sustainable competitive advantage

Sustainable competitive advantage is difficult and few companies have the resources to achieve it. 

##### Isolating Mechanisms to Protect Your Valuable and Rare Resources

- - **Better expectations of future resource value** - investing in items that will increase in value before others
  - **Path dependencies** - being further along in a set order of steps (clinical trials) or having structures that do not hinder changing paths
  - **Causal ambiguity** - lack of transparency on processes can make those processes difficulty to imitate
  - **Social complexity** - creating a social culture that is difficult to replicate by other firms
  - **Intellectual property (IP) protection** - patents can make your resource difficult to imitate
