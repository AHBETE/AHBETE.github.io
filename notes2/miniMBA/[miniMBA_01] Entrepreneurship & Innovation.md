- Channels and Key Metrics - how you will connect to your customers and what you need to measure as you make strategic decisions
- Cost Structure - startup and operation costs - how money goes out of your business
- Revenue Streams - the money you make - how money comes into your business

### The Value Proposition: The Heart of Any New Venture

- It is the basis for the entire business model.
