### The Creative Process & an Overview of Design Thinking

##### The Design Thinking Process

1. 1. Empathize - share the feelings of others to understand our consumers' needs 
   2. Define - understand the real problem you are solving by using tools such as ethnography; watching how people behave in their wild habitat or how they express themselves online.
   3. Ideate - brainstorm a lot of ideas and determine which ideas are the best possible solutions 
   4. Prototype - some form of draft that allows us to test our ideas before committing to doing them 
   5. Test - solicit honest feedback in order to drive improvements

##### Brainstorming

- - Go for quantity - don't focus on your first idea
  - Build on the ideas of others
  - Seek wild and unusual ideas
  - Don't judge your ideas until after the ideas are generated

Use a creative diamond approach to brainstorming and start with a challenge question that poses what ***might*** be possible.

##### Rules for Gathering Feedback

1. 1. Fall in love with the problem, not your solution.
   2. Solicit honest feedback from people.
   3. Use a feedback loop and use what is learned to rebuild and improve the solution until it is a "wow."



### Tools to Carry On

##### Defining questions to Consider

- Are we solving the right problem? 

*Reconsider ALL of the customer journey.*

- What other challenge questions might help us look at all of the most critical problems?

*What else should we be asking ourselves to dig deeper?*

- Do we have a brilliant solution or just an idea that needs further development?

*Do we benefit by revisiting the solution?*

- Have we converged on the best parameters?

*Keep the novelty of your solution alive.*
