#  [MiniMBA_07] What is a Supply Chain and Why is it Important?

### Supply Chain Management

A supply chain is the network of firms which comprise the entire process used to deliver a finished product to a consumer.

Supply chain management is how a firm manages the flow of material used to provide a good or a service.

- - Planning production
  - Sourcing material
  - Managing inventory
  - Locating facilities
  - Selecting transportation modes

Supply chain management is important because it has a significant impact on the product ***cost***, ***quality***, and ***availability.***



### Supply Chain Strategy

There are four main supply chain strategies.

1. Efficient
2. Risk-Hedging
3. Responsive
4. Agile

The choice of proper strategy depends on the level of ***supply*** **risk** and a product’s level of ***demand uncertainty***.



##### Demand Uncertainty

Functional products

- - Consumer staples: shampoos, grocery items, office supplies, etc.
  - Low demand variation and accurate forecasts

Innovative products

- - novel products with high demand uncertainty: fashion items, high tech electronics
  - unpredictable demand makes forecasting difficult
  - prone to shortages and excess inventory at the end of a selling season 

##### Supply Uncertainty

Stable supply base

- - supply base is mature and well-established
  - raw material is standard
  - common and available material such as plastics, metal, electrical connectors, etc.

Evolving supply base

- - supply base is evolving
  - high level of supply uncertainty
  - supply is prone to sources of risk such as breakdowns, low or variable yields.

##### Four Strategies

Efficient Supply Chain

- - primarily cost and efficiency focused
  - remove non-value adding steps, reduce inventory, gain scale economies, increase capacity utilization

Responsive Supply Chain

- - aimed at flexibility to changing/diverse customer needs
  - reduce lead-times, maintain excess capacity, make-to-order and mass customization

Risk-Hedging Supply Chain

- - reduce uncertainty of supply
  - carry extra inventory, pooling and share resources, increase number of suppliers and develop raw material alternatives

Agile Supply Chain

- - combination of responsive and risk-hedging strategies
  - pool resources, identify alternative suppliers, hold more inventory, delay product differentiation, shorten lead times

### Strategic Sourcing

- Allows a company to create a competitive advantage while reducing cost by moving some internal functions to external suppliers. 



##### Reasons to outsource 

- - Financial - reduce costs, improve ROI (return on investment), generate cash
  - Improvement Driven - obtain higher quality, lower cost, shorter lead-times by relying on supplier expertise
  - Organizationally driven - Allow company to focus on its core competencies

The reason to outsource can be one of these reasons or a combination of multiple reasons.

##### Outsourcing Considerations

Coordination

- - Monitor the performance of the company
  - Reducing opportunism

Strategic control 

- - Specific investment of either money or time in assets, people, processes, etc.
  - Investments would be difficult to recreate if outsourcing relationship terminates

Intellectual property

- - Is the function proprietary or a core function which makes your product better and cheaper than competitors?
  - Yield value which competitors cannot deliver

### The Bullwhip Effect

- In the bullwhip effect, the variability in the size and timing of orders increase as you move up the supply chain.
- A small fluctuation in demand at a retailer becomes a large order at the supplier.



##### Consequences of the Bullwhip Effect

The Bullwhip Effect can result in:

- - Poor forecasts
  - Excess supply chain inventory
  - Excess capacity and poor utilization
  - Decreased transportation efficiency

##### Causes of the Bullwhip Effect

Demand forecast updating

- - Modify expectations for future demand
  - Update required stocking levels and order quantities needed to satisfy this projection

Order batching

- - Allow customer orders to accumulate before placing replenishment order with your supplier.
  - Due to fixed ordering and transportation costs. 

Price fluctuations

- - Due to promotions and forward buying.
  - Customers buy in larger quantities than they actually need. 

Rationing and shortage gaming

- - When demand exceeds supply, manufacturers ration and customers exaggerate needs.
  - “Phantom” orders surge

##### How to counter the Bullwhip Effect?

- Share demand information such as point-of-sale data or have your vendor or supplier manage the transaction of inventory between you and them.
- Break up order batches by automating ordering, using mixed-product truckloads, or using a third-party logistics provider.
- Reduce reliance on promotions to generate sales by using every day low prices.
- Reduce gaming by making customers aware of inventory status and removing incentives for companies to place larger orders than needed.

### Supply Chain Dynamics

##### Process Variation

Variation acts upon any process

- - Demand variation
  - Late deliveries
  - Defects
  - Breakdowns

Variation degrades the performance of a process! 

##### Process Management Triangle

Relationship between Capacity, Inventory, Variation

- - Inventory and capacity act as buffers to variation, limiting its negative effect on a process
  - Capacity can be a tradeoff with inventory. Increasing inventory can enable a decrease in capacity (and vice versa)
  - Reducing variation (possibly by using information) potentially allows you to reduce both capacity and inventory.
